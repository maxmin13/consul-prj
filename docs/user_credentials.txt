Authentication tokens are time stamped. 
If your datetime is wrong on your local computer your credentials will be invalid and you will 
get "AWS was not able to validate the provided credentials". 
It's a bit misleading but it is what it is. 
Set your time with below command or set up NTP.

sudo date -s "$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"
