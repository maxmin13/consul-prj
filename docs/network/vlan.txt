Just know that subnetting is logical network division through addressing. 
Subnetting alone DOES NOT equal segmentation. 

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a network into individual network segments, 
generally through the use of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs).





A LAN is a group of computers or other devices in the same place -- e.g., the same building or campus -- that share the same physical network. A LAN is usually associated with an Ethernet (Layer 2) broadcast domain, which is the set of network devices an Ethernet broadcast packet can reach.

Computers on the LAN connect to the same network switch, either directly or through wireless access points (APs) connected to the same switch. Computers can also connect to one of a set of interconnected switches, such as a set of access switches that all connect up to a backbone switch. Once traffic crosses a router and engages Layer 3 (IP-related) functions, it is not considered to be on the same LAN, even if everything stays in the same building or floor. As a result, a location could have many interconnected LANs.

A VLAN, like the LAN it sits atop, operates at Layer 2 of the network, the Ethernet level. VLANs partition a single switched network into a set of overlaid virtual networks that can meet different functional and security requirements. This partitioning avoids the need to have multiple, distinct physical networks for different use cases.
