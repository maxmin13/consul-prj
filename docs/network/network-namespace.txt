A network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own
 
 	routes, 
	firewall rules,
 	network devices.

By default a process inherits its network namespace from its parent. Initially all the processes share the same default
network namespace from the init process.

By convention a named network namespace is an object at /var/run/netns/NAME that can be opened.
The file descriptor resulting from opening 

 	/var/run/netns/NAME 

refers to the specified network namespace. Holding that file descriptor open  keeps the network namespace alive. The file descriptor can be used with the setns(2) system call to change the network namespace associated with a task.

For applications that are aware of network namespaces, the convention is to look for global network configuration files first in 

 	/etc/netns/NAME/  then in /etc/  

For example, if you want a different version of /etc/resolv.conf for a network namespace used to isolate your vpn you would name it
       
       /etc/netns/myvpn/resolv.conf.
