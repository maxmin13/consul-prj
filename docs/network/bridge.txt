A bridge is a piece of software used to unite two or more network segments.
A bridge behaves like a virtual network switch, 
working transparently (the other machines do not need to know about its existence). 
Any real devices (e.g. eth0) and virtual devices (e.g. tap0) can be connected to it.
management of a network bridge using the ip tool from the iproute2 package.


     ip link add name bridge_name type bridge

     ip link set dev bridge_name up

To add an interface (e.g. eth0) into the bridge, its state must be up:

     ip link set eth0 up

Adding the interface into the bridge is done by setting its master to bridge_name:

     ip link set eth0 master bridge_name

To show the existing bridges and associated interfaces, use the bridge utility (also part of iproute2). See bridge(8) for details.

     bridge link

This is how to remove an interface from a bridge:

     ip link set eth0 nomaster

The interface will still be up, so you may also want to bring it down:

     ip link set eth0 down

To delete a bridge issue the following command:

     ip link delete bridge_name type bridge

This will automatically remove all interfaces from the bridge. The slave interfaces will still be up, though, so you may also want to bring them down after.

Assigning an IP address

     ip address add dev bridge_name 192.168.66.66/24
