## Consul datacenter

Amazon AWS datacenter that runs AWS EC2 instances with Linux 2 os. Every instance runs a Docker service:
Nginx server, Sinatra server, Redis database, Jenkins pipeline.

The Admin instance acts as a jumpbox. Dockerfiles are uploaded to it and the images for each service are built
and uploaded to AWS ECR registry. Each instance downloads the image from the registry and runs a container from it.

A cluster of Consul agensts is run in the datacenter.
<br/> 
The admin instance acts as Consul server agent, each other instance as Consul client agent.
<br/> 
Consul web ui is published at the address:
<br/><br/>
http://${admin-instance-public-ip}/ui/consul
<br/><br/>
In each instance Consul is configured to bind its HTTP, CLI RPC, and DNS services to the 169.254.1.1 address.
<br/> 
The cluster gossip is exchanged in the 10.0.10.0/24 network.
<br/>
dnsmaq acts as DNS service for the instance and the containers. It passes queries ending in .consul to the Consul agent, while
all the remaining queries are passed to the AWS DNS service at 10.0.0.2.
<br/>
A Registrator container in each instance automatically registers and deregisters with Consul services for any Docker container by inspecting containers as they come online.
<br/>

In each AWS instance or in each container, Consul services can be queried by calling:
<br/><br/>
curl http://${CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR}/v1/catalog/service/jenkins?pretty
<br/><br/>
dig jenkins.maxmin.it.node.consul
<br/><br/>
In an application running in a Ruby container, 
an example of the code to retrieve the database address and port may be:

```
uri = URI.parse("http://#{ENV['CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR']}/v1/catalog/service/redis?pretty")

http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
response = http.request(request)
body = response.body
address = JSON.parse(body)[0]['ServiceAddress']
port = JSON.parse(body)[0]['ServicePort']
redis = Redis.new(:host => address, :port => port)
```
